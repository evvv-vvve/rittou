<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rittou serves as a testbed for me to mess around with Rust and improve with the language, similar to an old discord bot of mine, [Yuki](https://github.com/evvv-vvve/yuki), which Rittou is technically a reimagining of.


The idea is for Rittou to be an all-in-one bot, similar to Yuki, compressing often-used commands and features into one with added goodies and tidbits here and there.
